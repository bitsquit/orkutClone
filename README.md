# orkutClone

## This is something that I always wanted to make but never got the time, but times are different now :-) 

I haven't still decided the name but I guess **Forkut** would be fine.

So this project as the name suggest would be a clone of Orkut social networking website that existed even before when facebook came into picture and overshadowed it. However, personally I feel that Orkut's UI/UX was better plus as far as I could remember it didn't have advertisements either. Anyways this project would be combination of features that we get from facebook plus the features that Orkut originally provided.

I have got a screenshot from my profile back from 2005ish which would serve to layout the UI for this project. I request everyone to do contribute to it if you find it interesting. For now I'm working on a different project and as soon as that is finished I would give my time to this one.

### I would add a roadmap in a few days so stay tuned.
